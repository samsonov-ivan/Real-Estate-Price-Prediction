# Real Estate Price Prediction

---

## Target

The project aims to predict **real estate prices**. Main goal - compare different models:
Linear Regression, CatBoost and Sklearn model, and after choose the best way to prediction 
real estate price.

Ultimately, we'll build a fully functional service where anyone can input apartment details
and get an instant price forecast. We'll set up an attractive web dashboard to showcase our results
and general metricks by regions.
